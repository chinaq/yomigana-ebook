# yomigana ebook

This project is aimed at making Japanese e-books more friendly to those who are learning Japanese by adding readings to Kanji.

To achieve this, the project utilizes Mecab, a Japanese morphological analyzer, and Unidic, a dictionary developed by NICT, to tokenize words and obtain the corresponding yomi (reading) of each word. This information is then inserted above or beside the kanji characters in the e-book text, allowing readers to easily read and understand the pronunciation of each word.
